# âœ¨ Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome and appreciate all valuable contributions. To ensure a smooth and collaborative process, please review these guidelines before submitting a pull request.

## Golden Rules

To maintain the quality and focus of this list, please adhere to the following principles:

* **Relevance Over Self-Promotion**: This repository aims to be a high-quality resource. While you are welcome to submit your own projects, please ensure they genuinely meet the project's criteria and provide value to the community. Submissions that appear to be primarily for self-promotion may be closed without review.
* **Search First**: Before submitting, please perform a quick search of existing pull requests and issues to see if your suggestion has been submitted before. This helps avoid duplicate efforts.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

We kindly ask that you follow these steps to make your contribution easy to review and merge.

1.  **Create a Dedicated Branch**: Always work in a separate branch, not on `main`. Name your branch something descriptive, like `feat/add-project-name`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/add-your-project-name
    ```
2.  **One Change Per PR**: Please submit only one new link or suggestion per pull request. This keeps changes focused and makes the review process much faster.

3.  **Follow the Correct Format**:
    * Add your entry to the **bottom** of the relevant category.
    * Ensure your submission maintains the established formatting of the list.
    * Check for and remove any trailing whitespace.

4.  **Write a Clear Commit Message**: Your commit message should be concise and descriptive of the change you are making.

5.  **Create a Great Pull Request**:
    * **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title in the format `Add: Project Name` or `Fix: Brief description of fix`.
    * **Description**: Provide a meaningful description that explains *what* you are adding and *why* it is a valuable addition to this list. The more context you provide, the better.

6.  **Code & Content Quality**:
    * Please double-check your spelling and grammar.
    * Ensure all links are working and direct to the correct resource.

We also welcome suggestions for new categories or improvements to the existing structure. Feel free to open an issue to discuss your ideas first.

Thank you again for your contribution!
