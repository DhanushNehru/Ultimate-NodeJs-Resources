# 🚀 Node.js Learning Roadmap

A structured path to mastering **Node.js** for back-end development and building production-ready APIs.  

---

## 📌 1. Node.js Fundamentals & Servers (✅ 7% Done)

**What to Learn:**
- What Node.js is and why it’s used in back-end development.
- How the **event loop** and **asynchronous programming** work.
- Using **Node.js core modules**: `fs`, `path`, `os`, `http`.
- Creating a basic **HTTP server** with Node.js.
- Handling requests and responses manually.

**Milestone Project:**  
📝 Build a simple **HTTP server** that serves static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

---

## 📌 2. Express.js Fundamentals (✅ 13% Done)

**What to Learn:**
- Setting up an Express server.
- Defining **routes** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Using **middleware** (built-in & custom).
- Serving static files with Express.
- Templating engines (EJS, Handlebars, or Pug).

**Milestone Project:**  
📝 Build a **Blog server** with Express.js that supports multiple routes and serves HTML pages.

---

## 📌 3. Database Integration with MongoDB & Mongoose (✅ 6% Done)

**What to Learn:**
- Introduction to **NoSQL** and MongoDB basics.
- Connecting Node.js to MongoDB using **Mongoose**.
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Schema design: One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.
- Data validation & error handling.

**Milestone Project:**  
📝 Build a **Task Manager** app where users can add, update, and delete tasks stored in MongoDB.

---

## 📌 4. Building Complete APIs (✅ 7% Done)

**What to Learn:**
- REST API design principles (resources, endpoints, status codes).
- Express Router for modular APIs.
- File upload handling with `multer`.
- Integrating with external APIs (e.g., weather, payment gateways).
- Returning JSON responses with proper error handling.

**Milestone Project:**  
📝 Build a **Movies API** with endpoints to fetch, add, update, and delete movies.

---

## 📌 5. User Authentication (✅ 50% Done)

**What to Learn:**
- Authentication vs Authorization.
- Password hashing with **bcrypt**.
- Session-based authentication (cookies & sessions).
- **JWT authentication** for stateless APIs.
- Role-based access control (User vs Admin).

**Milestone Project:**  
📝 Create an **Auth API** with user registration, login, logout, and JWT-protected routes.

---

## 📌 6. Capstone Project: Core Banking API 💳  

**Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)  

**Features to Implement:**
- Secure **JWT authentication** for users.  
- Users can **send money** to each other.  
- Transaction records stored in MongoDB.  
- Admin dashboard with full **transaction log**.  
- Simple **frontend** with HTML/CSS (or React if ready).  

**Stretch Goals:**
- Add **rate limiting** (to prevent abuse).  
- Add **input validation** with `Joi` or `Zod`.  
- Deploy backend to **Render/Heroku** and database to **MongoDB Atlas**.  

---

## 📌 7. Advanced Topics (Optional, Post-Capstone)

- WebSockets with **Socket.IO** for real-time apps.  
- Caching with **Redis**.  
- Unit & integration testing with **Jest** or **Mocha/Chai**.  
- Deployment pipelines with Docker + CI/CD.  

---

## ✅ Progress Tracker  

- Fundamentals: **7%**  
- Express.js: **13%**  
- Database: **6%**  
- APIs: **7%**  
- Authentication: **50%**  
- Capstone: 🚧 Not started
