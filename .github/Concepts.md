## 1. Core Concepts

- **Node.js Overview & Architecture**: Learn how Node.js works, including its single-threaded, event-driven nature.  
- **Event Loop & Asynchronous Programming**: Understanding the event loop, callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
- **Modules**: CommonJS (`require`) and ES Modules (`import`) for organizing code.  
- **npm & Package Management**: Installing, updating, and managing packages with npm or yarn.  
- **Global Objects**: `process`, `__dirname`, `__filename`, `Buffer`, etc.

## 2. Built-in Modules

- **fs (File System)**: Reading, writing, and managing files.  
- **http / https**: Creating servers and making HTTP requests.  
- **path**: Handling and transforming file paths.  
- **events**: EventEmitter class and custom events.  
- **stream**: Working with streams for reading/writing large data efficiently.  
- **buffer**: Handling binary data.

## 3. Advanced Concepts

- **Error Handling & Debugging**: Try-Catch, `.catch()`, EventEmitter `error` events, Node.js inspector, VSCode debugger.  
- **EventEmitter & Custom Events**: Emitting and listening to events.  
- **Streams & Buffers**: Efficient data handling for large files or network data.  
- **Child Processes**: Spawning and managing child processes for CPU-intensive tasks.  
- **Clustering & Performance**: Using cluster module to utilize multiple CPU cores.
